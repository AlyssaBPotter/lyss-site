Feyre

I lean the bouquet of assorted flowers against his tombstone and stand back up, slowly. Tears stream down my cheeks as memories from that night flood through me. What was supposed to be one of the most amazing nights of our lives high school graduation turned into a complete nightmare that ultimately changed my life. I still haven't recovered. 

It's been three years since the accident and the nightmares still haunt me sometimes, which are followed by a tsunami wave of survivors guilt. I was there and I should have died too, but somehow I managed to survive. It went from a silly, drunken decision to the worst mistake of my life so fast. We had been drunk on the beach, a hundred yards away from the graduation party we were at. We were passing a bottle of whisky back and forth, when I decided I wanted to skinny dip in the freezing ocean. 

Archer joined me because why not? It was one of the things that brought us together spontaneous ideas even if they were a little crazy sometimes. He was my best friend and the first guy I had ever, truly loved. Jack was inside with whatever girl clung to him but eventually he came out to find us. I was running down the beach towards the water with Arch hot on my tail. We both ran into the water with zero hesitation and dove head first into the waves. 

I remember looking back and seeing Jack and some girl sitting in the sand near our clothes, sipping on the bottle of whiskey. I waved to him and he gave me one back. Archer grabbed me and we kissed, swam around and splashed each other. He swam farther out and that's when a huge wave came in and sucked us into the undertow. I remember trying not to panic and fighting to get to the surface when strong arms wrap around my waist and bring me up. 

I blacked out after that and woke up in the hospital. They were able to resuscitate me and get me breathing again, but not Archer. He hit his head on a rock, knocked out and drowned before they were able to find him. I found out in the hospital and had a complete mental break down because I felt responsible since it was my irrational idea. I haven't been the same since then and honestly, I don't think I ever will be. I hate the ocean and haven't been since the accident. 

I come home for the weekend every year around this time to visit his grave and see his family. We grew up together, his family lives next door so our families have always been close. He has a younger sister Noel whose my brother Greyson's age who's been like a younger sister to me all these years. We talk often and FaceTime to catch up on life. I feel even more responsible of her since he's been gone. 

My mom cooks us all a big family dinner where we share stories and reminisce. I leave the following evening, back to Cambridge with Jack. Kenzie, my best friends picks us up from the airport and drives us back to our apartment. We drop Jack off at the hockey house and then we head to our place. 

I'm quiet the whole ride, staring out the window. It's the beginning of summer break. So the suns been setting later and it's warm all through out the night. I came to terms with everything a while ago, after a lot of therapy and working on myself. But, around this time I get taken back to that dark night and it sucks all of the light and happiness away from me for a little bit. Kenzie knows, she's been there for me since we met our freshman year in the dorms. 

I feel her blue eyes one of "You okay Fey?" She asks calmly. 

I turn and flash her a half smile "I'm alright, just... missing him more than usual today" I say with a sigh. 

She lightly squeezes my shoulder to provide some comfort "He's always with you Fey, smiling down and watching you move on with your life. He would be so proud of you, never forget that" 

She's always been the voice of reason for me "Thank you, I needed to hear that. I just miss him, all the time and seeing his parents brings back the guilt that I've worked through" 

"It wasn't your fault Fey and they know that. No one has ever blamed you, you were a victim too" her words are calming. 

"It was my idea" I say under my breath but she hears it. 

"He wanted to go with you, I've heard the story enough to know that you didn't make him do anything. It was an accident that no one could have predicted and you need to stop blaming yourself" she pulls into the parking garage and turns the engine off. 

I look over at her "I know" we both get out and walk over to the elevator that she going to take us up to our floor. 

We get inside and I head to my room and unpack all of my belongings. I take a shower and then lay in bed texting with Jack and Noel until I fall asleep. I wake up through out the night, tossing and turning as the nightmares flood back through and haunt me. I always wake up right before I'm about to drowned. 

The next couple of days I spend working at the coffee shop that I manage down the street and trying not to go back to the dark place that I pulled myself out of. We get our usual morning rush and around noon is when it starts to slow down. Jack and some of his hockey buddies come in "Hey Fey" he says with a grin. 

"Hey guys, what can I get you?" They each give me their order and when Storm steps up I freeze. 

Storm is Jack's best friend and the hockey team captain. He's also one of the best players on the East Coast and is on his way to the NHL after graduation. He's tall, lean and sculpted with that natural broody look that has all the girls weak in the knees. His eyes are a dark chestnut brown along with his chocolate brown curly hair. He has tattoos scattered along his arms and probably some other body parts and the cutest dimples on each of his cheeks. 

He's ridiculously handsome and knows it. He's also one of the biggest playboys on the team, breaking hearts left and right. He hasn't been in a relationship since I've known him but has a different puck bunny in his bed each night or that's at least what I hear. I've only ever spoken to him a handful of times because he's pretty quiet unless he's on the prowl. 

He stares down at me because he's tall, towering over my five foot four frame "Vanilla Latte and a blueberry muffin" is all he says and I ring it in. 

He pulls out his card to pay for the guys "Is this for everything?" I ask. 

He nods "Yes it is Beauty" I run it through and hand it back with a receipt and pen. 

He signs and slides it back leaving a twenty dollar tip. I stare down at it and look back at him in shock, he winks at me with a smirk and my cheeks flush red. I mentally curse at myself for my body reacting this way towards him. He's the kind of guy I should actively avoid knowing that he's a natural flirt and charmer, so he makes all the girls feel this way. 

"Beauty?" I ask and his grin only grows wider. 

"Yeah, it suits you" my heart races. 

"Bet you say that to every girl... and they fall for it?" I try to mask how it really makes my insides feel. 

He shrugs "Usually but you don't?" I laugh. 

"Nope, I guess I'm immune to that charm of yours" I put the receipt in the drawer after entering in the tip. 

Lexi, the barista heats up his muffin and starts working on all of their drinks "C'mon on Beauty no one's immune to this charm" he says all cocky. 

"That's because the girls you use it on typically have a lower IQ" he tilts his head back in laughter. 

"Damn, that was cold Fey" I shrug. 

"Lexi will call your name when it's ready" I turn to walk away when he stops me. 

"Hey, wait... are you coming to the party tonight?" He asks curiously. 

Unfortunately I am because Kenzie talked me into it, to kick off summer break "I am actually" his brows raise like he's surprised. 

"I look forward to seeing you" he winks one more time and then walks off to join the rest of the guys. 

I turn away and catch Lexi looking at me "What?" I ask and she smiles with a giggle. 

"He was flirting with you Fey" I sigh and lean against the counter. 

"I know, but he also flirts with everyone so it's not special or anything" 

"I don't know, the way he looked at you.... It seemed different than how he interacts with the puck bunnies who chase him. Trust me, I've seen them in action and he's usually a little cold to them" she says. 

"Weird, well I'm not going to let it flatter me. He's friends with Jack so that's probably why he feels the need to be nice" I walk over to the cash register as another customer comes inside. 

Lexi calls out the order for the guys and I start making the next order. We start to get another small rush so I get right into work mode and hustle. Occasionally I feel eyes on me and look over to see Storm watching my every move with a neutral look on his face like what I'm doing is making him curious or interested. They end up leaving an hour later and the shop dies down. We close around two and I spend the rest of my time in the back, counting money and taking inventory on our stock. 

I get home around four to Kenzie dancing around the apartment, drinking a cocktail. She makes me one as we both sing along to each Pop song that plays on through the speakers. We end up getting pretty buzzes and then start getting ready for the party around seven. She curls my hair once I finish my makeup and then we both get dressed. 

I decide on a black faux leather shorts with a strapless crop top that only shows a little of my stomach and a pair of vans. I put on my favorite nude lipstick and spray some perfume. Kenz looks phenomenal in her baby blue dress and ankle boots. We take a million selfies and chug our last drink, before heading out to our Uber. 

I feel buzzed during the ride to the hockey house. Our driver plays some fun music that we sing along to and I love that the anxiety that's usually in the pit of my stomach is gone. I've been to plenty of parties at the hockey house but tonight feels different than the rest. My phone vibrates and I see a message from Jack asking where I am. I respond letting him know that we're on our way. 

Jack has had a crush on Kenzie since I met her. But, she's not one to do relationships. She is the definition of a heart breaker and is focused on school while enjoying some fun on the side. She's a Business major who is hoping to take over her dad's Tech company someday so she tries to remain focused and not let a guy distract her. 

Kenzie's stunning, like a model. Blonde wavy hair, ocean blue eyes and sun kissed skin. She's from California, Malibu to be exact and has that whole surfer, Barbie vibe but she's one of the sweetest, most genuine and hardest working people I know. You would never really guess that she had a privileged life except for the fact that she's at Harvard. That's what I love the most about her. 

Our Uber pulls up to the house and we climb out. She interlocks our arms as we walk up the steps to the large, wooden front door. You can hear the music and voices from the drive way. She pushes the door open and we're met with loud music and sweaty bodies to shove through. She leads us to the kitchen and I grab a couple solo cups to make us drinks. 

Jack walks over and gives us each a hug "My favorite girls are here" he says with a grin. 

"Do you hear that?" I ask and he stares at me confused. 

"What?" 

"The sounds of all those puck bunnies hearts breaking from that comment" I say with a smile and he laughs. 

"Funny Fey, really funny. Kenz you look fucking hot" he wiggles his brows and I notice the blush that spreads across her cheeks. 

I hand her a cup and finish making mine, when I look around the kitchen and the the living room. My eyes lock into a pair of dark ones that are already staring back at me. My heart races and stomach flips into somersaults Storm. 

I want to look away, but can't because there's something about him that's pulling me in.
