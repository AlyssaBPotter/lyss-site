Slipping Away


“Saylor! Saylor! Oh, my God," is all I hear as everything around me becomes hazy. I feel the weight of my body pull me down until I hit the cold tile.  I don't remember much, but something that stands out is feeling cold, like I am floating in an ice bath. I can barely hear anything around me. All the voices are jumbled, and then darkness envelopes me.

I wake up to a beeping noise; my vision is blurry, and my throat feels like sandpaper. I blink a few times until my vision starts to clear, and I see that I'm at the hospital. I look down and see the bandages on my forearm and the different cords that are all connected to me. I try to sit up, but my head feels like it weighs a thousand, and I almost puke. I hear voices outside the door, and I try to call out for help. Nothing comes out; my voice is raspy like I haven't spoken in days. I try to clear my throat, but it only makes it worse.  Finally I see my mom's brown hair appear in the doorway, and, when she sees me, her eyes widen in surprise. She rushes to my bedside: "Saylor, you're awake!" I stare into her tear-stained eyes and see the pain hidden behind them.

"Mom" is all I manage to get out, as she cradles my face with her hands. A moment later my father walks in with a doctor.

"Saylor" is all he says as he takes a seat next to my mom.

The doctor stands at the edge of the hospital bed and jots a few things down on his clipboard. He clears his throat: "Saylor, I'm so happy you're awake. How do you feel?" His voice is calm.

"My throat is dry and my head is killing me.”  it comes out like a whisper, and he nods.

"I'll get you something for both.  Do you know why you're here?"  My mom squeezes my arm.

I nod as I stare down at my arms:  "I tried…I hurt...I cut myself."  I finally get it out, half out of breath.

"You did, and because of that we have you under observation to make sure you won't do it again. Unfortunately when the incident happened, you fell and hit your head pretty hard on the floor. You've been in a coma for a week."  My heart drops.

"It's okay, honey," my mom whispers in my ear and squeezes my hand.

"Oh" is all I manage to say, because what the hell do you say to that?

"I'll get you some medicine and let you rest. I'll speak with your parents outside." The doctor nods, and both of my parents stand, then follow him out.  My mom shuts the door behind her as I stare ahead at the wall and think; it didn't work. I wasn't supposed to be here or anywhere really. The only thing I thought I could accomplish, and I failed. I gently run my fingers over the bandages, and memories flash through me.

I remember having a panic attack in my room. I crawled into the fetal position next to my bed and cried until I felt like my throat was closing in. The room started to spin, and I just wanted it all to stop for once. I wanted the voice in my head to stop berating me. I wanted the pain I felt deep down to stop hurting so fucking much.

Yet here I am, alive and somewhat okay. I don't know how to feel or how to truly face the consequences of what I've done. Will my parents forgive me? Can I forgive myself? Can I continue on with my life like nothing happened? I have so many questions and zero answers. Right now, I don't regret it, but I'm pissed that it didn't work like I planned. I let out a long, deep sigh, and tears start to flood the corners of my eyes. I try to hold them back because I've already cried so much, and I promised myself I wouldn't do it again.  I quickly wipe my eyes, but the tears keep coming. My heart starts to race, so I grab the extra pillow and hold it to my chest. I try to steady my breathing, but nothing helps, and I feel like the walls are beginning to close in. 

Just then the door opens and my parents and the doctor come back inside.  The second they see me, my mom rushes over and holds me tight: It's okay, Say, just breathe...everything is okay."  My dad stands next to her with a stoic expression as usual. God forbid his daughter cause any embarrassment to him and his family.  A nurse walks in and injects what I assume is pain medicine into my IV. Less than a minute later I start to feel light, and things get a little hazy; the medicine is working. My heart rate slows down as the panic in me slowly disappears.

"We'll have to keep her here for a couple more days to monitor her. After that, if everything checks out, we'll discharge her, but she will have to see a psychiatrist weekly."  My parents agree, and the doctor exits.

I hear my dad sigh; "Why Saylor? Why did you do this?"  He sounds angry as he takes a seat by the window and stares out.

"Arthur, something must have brought her to this point," my mom says softly, and he laughs.

"Weakness, that's what happened. She lets everything get to her, and then she freaks out and does something stupid for attention. Jen, this isn't the first time, and it won't be the last." He runs a hand down his face as my eyes start to close.

My mom rubs my arm, completely ignoring him, and I remain quiet. He knows exactly why I did this, even if he wants to act oblivious. I told him; I told them both the night it happened, and they told me to keep it to myself: to “get over it” and not “to act so desperate.”  I went to them for help, and they silenced me.  No wonder I'm here. My dad reads a newspaper, like we're not sitting in a hospital room because I tried to kill myself. I open my eyes and stare at him, noticing how green his eyes are, just like mine, and how his dark hair is now speckled with grays. I look a good deal  like him and always have, but, beyond our physical appearance, we have nothing else in common. 

He's a District Attorney, the best in Connecticut. He's known for his cold, stoic behavior and ruthless ways in the courtroom. What no one realizes is he is also like that at home. He's always so closed off and cold, emotionless, to say the least. I don't think he's ever told me he loves me or my mom.  My mom is considerably more warm and caring. She's a fashion designer and  owns multiple boutiques all over Connecticut, New York, Los Angeles and Paris. She's a business woman and has always put in more effort than my father; selfishly I wish he tried harder.

I tried to be close with my mom and dad. I used to do anything good or bad to get their attention, even if it was only for a moment.  I've always wondered how they ended up together when they're polar opposites, but people do say that opposites attract.  I'm an only child, and at times it gets lonely, especially when both of them are traveling for work. I spent my elementary, middle school and early high school years at boarding school. Junior year I asked to spend it closer to home, and I fought tooth and nail; eventually they agreed.  I came home and enrolled at Greensward Prep, a private school near our house. I was nervous, to say the least, but held my head high. I made friends and even joined the cheerleading team. Things were going so much better than expected, until that night.

"Saylor, get some rest, okay? We'll come back tomorrow." My mom kisses my forehead as she follows my dad out into the hallway.

Once the door clicks shut, I close my eyes and hear their attempt at whispering: "The doctor said she lost the baby, okay? It's done."  My dad's voice is firm.  Baby? What baby? Then   the realization hits me...oh, my God, I was pregnant. My bottom lip quivers as I grab a pillow to muffle my cries. My entire body shakes as I scream into the pillow. I didn't know I was pregnant, but if I did would it have changed anything?

I hear their footsteps fade away, and eventually I'm able to calm myself. At this point I feel completely numb from everything that has happened. I look down at my wrists and wish I had gone deeper, because it would have hurt a hell of a lot less than how I'm feeling right now.  My chest tightens and heart aches for the possibility of a life I could have had and given my unborn child. Then I laugh, a loud ridiculous laugh that makes me feel like I'm going insane. I'm seventeen, how the hell could I have raised a child?  It’s not like my parents would ever have allowed that.  I roll over onto my side, and memories flood through me from that night, thoughts of how I wish I could have stopped him. If I were stronger or louder than maybe he would have stopped. I feel nauseous, and, because I’m too weak to stand up, I throw up on the side of my bed.  I buzz for a nurse who comes in and cleans up. She has a sympathetic look on her face and pats my arm before walking out. I wipe my mouth and drink some water, but nothing helps the ache in the pit of my stomach.

I need to get the hell out of here, out of this hospital and town. I have one year left of school, and, if I can push through it or finish early, then I can leave and never look back. I bet my parents will be happy to be rid of me, mainly my dad. He always wished he had a son, and I've been nothing but a disappointment since I could talk.  I may not be sure of a lot, but what I do know is I want to do better and be better. I refuse to let what happened define me, even though sometimes starting over feels impossible. I lie back onto the bed, close my eyes and dream about a new life for myself.
